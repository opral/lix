Rebuilt the storage engine's physical layout: merges run 1.8x faster, point reads 2.2x faster, and commits write 47% fewer bytes.

Measured on the repository benchmarks: merge_10k through the e2e CSV plugin pipeline 347.8 ms to 190.0 ms, read_one_by_pk 213.1 us to 96.2 us, bytes written per 1k-row insert commit 827,460 to 436,472, backend puts per commit 2,031 to 1,074. Payloads are now stored exactly once, each engine keyspace maps to its own SQLite table, and keys use binary UUIDs with front-coded chunk encoding. The SQLite file format version moves to 3; v0.7 opens fresh files only and rejects older files with an explicit error.
