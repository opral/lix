# Introducing Lix: A universal version control system

## Introduction

Lix is a **universal version control system** that can diff any file format (`.xlsx`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, etc).

Unlike Git's line-based diffs, Lix understands file structure. Lix sees `price: 10 → 12` or `cell B4: pending → shipped`, not "line 4 changed" or "binary files differ". 

This makes Lix the ideal version control layer for AI agents operating on non-code formats.

### Excel file example

An AI agent updates an order status in `orders.xlsx`.


**Before:**
```diff
  | order_id | product  | status   |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | 1001     | Widget A | shipped  |
  | 1002     | Widget B | pending |
```

**After:**
```diff
  | order_id | product  | status   |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | 1001     | Widget A | shipped  |
  | 1002     | Widget B | shipped |
```

**Git sees:**

```diff
-Binary files differ
```

**Lix sees:**

```diff
order_id 1002 status: 

- pending
+ shipped
```

### JSON file example

Even for structured text file formats like `.json` lix is tracking semantics rather than line by line diffs. 

**Before:**
```json
{"theme":"light","notifications":true,"language":"en"}
```

**After:**
```json
{"theme":"dark","notifications":true,"language":"en"}
```

**Git sees:**
```diff
-{"theme":"light","notifications":true,"language":"en"}
+{"theme":"dark","notifications":true,"language":"en"}
```

**Lix sees:**

```diff
property theme: 
- light
+ dark
```

## AI agents need version control

Changes AI agents make need to be reviewable by humans.

For code, Git solves this: review the diff, reject bad changes, roll back mistakes. 

Lix brings these primitives to any file format, not just text:

- **Reviewable diffs**: See exactly what an agent changed in any file format.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Agents propose, humans approve.
- **Safe rollback**: Undo mistakes instantly.

```ts
import { openLix } from "@lix-js/sdk";

const lix = await openLix({

});

await lix.db.insertInto("file").values({ path: "/hello.txt", data: ... }).execute();

const diff = selectWorkingDiff({ lix })
```


## How does Lix work?

Lix adds a version control system on top of SQL databases.

The Lix SDK exposes virtual tables like `file`, `file_history` that are queryable with plain SQL. 

**Why this matters:**

- **Lix doesn't reinvent databases** — durability, ACID, and corruption recovery are handled by battle-tested SQL databases.
- **Full SQL support** — query your version control system with the same SQL.
- **Can runs in your existing database** — no separate storage layer to manage.

## Why did we built lix? 

Lix was developed alongside [inlang](https://inlang.com), open-source localization infrastructure.

Solving localization requires Git's collaboration model (branches, diffs, merges) but Git only handles text files, in addition to other issues (see ["Git is unsuited for applications"](https://samuelstroschein.com/blog/git-limitations)). 

We had to develop a new version control system that addressed git's limitations inlang ran into. The result is Lix, now at over [90k weekly downloads on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lix-js/sdk).

## What's next

The next version of Lix will be a refactor to be purely "preprocessor" based. This enables:

- **Fast writes** ([RFC 001](/rfc/001-preprocess-writes))
- **Any SQL database** (SQLite, Postgres, Turso, MySQL)
- **SDKs for Python, Rust, Go** ([RFC 002](/rfc/002-rewrite-in-rust))

```
                      ┌────────────────┐
  SELECT * FROM ...   │  Lix Engine    │   SELECT * FROM ...
 ───────────────────▶ │    (Rust)      │ ───────────────────▶  Database
                      └────────────────┘
```
