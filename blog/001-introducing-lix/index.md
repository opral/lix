# Introducing Lix: Embeddable version control for AI agents

## AI agents need version control

Changes AI agents make need to be reviewable by humans.

For code, Git solves this. But Git is hard to embed into applications. It's a CLI tool, not a library. And Git does not store "changes" (deltas). To see what changed, you have to compare two snapshots of a file.

## Introducing Lix


Lix is an **embeddable version control system** that runs inside your application.

It records schema-aware changes (via plugins) to enable diffs, reviews, rollback, and querying of edits — **as part of your product**:

- **Track every action of agents** — see exactly what an agent did and when (edits, proposals, and approvals).
- **Display meaningful diffs** — show what actually changed in structured data and documents, without noisy line-by-line churn.
- **Rollback changes** — discard proposals, roll back state, and isolate experiments safely.

## Excel file example

An AI agent updates an order status in `orders.xlsx`.


**Before:**
```diff
  | order_id | product  | status   |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | 1001     | Widget A | shipped  |
  | 1002     | Widget B | pending |
```

**After:**
```diff
  | order_id | product  | status   |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | 1001     | Widget A | shipped  |
  | 1002     | Widget B | shipped |
```

**Git sees:**

```diff
-Binary files differ
```

**Lix sees:**

```diff
order_id 1002 status: 

- pending
+ shipped
```


## JSON file example

Even for structured text file formats like `.json` lix is tracking semantics rather than line by line diffs.

**Before:**
```json
{"theme":"light","notifications":true,"language":"en"}
```

**After:**
```json
{"theme":"dark","notifications":true,"language":"en"}
```

**Git sees:**
```diff
-{"theme":"light","notifications":true,"language":"en"}
+{"theme":"dark","notifications":true,"language":"en"}
```

**Lix sees:**

```diff
property theme: 
- light
+ dark
```

## How does Lix work?

Lix adds a version control system on top of SQL databases that let's you query virtual tables like `file`, `file_history`, etc. via plain SQL. These table's are version controlled.

**Why this matters:**

- **Lix doesn't reinvent databases** — durability, ACID, and corruption recovery are handled by battle-tested SQL databases.
- **Full SQL support** — query your version control system with the same SQL.
- **Can runs in your existing database** — no separate storage layer to manage.

## Why did we build lix?

Lix was developed alongside [inlang](https://inlang.com), open-source localization infrastructure.

We had to develop a new version control system that addressed git's limitations inlang ran into, see (see ["Git is unsuited for applications"](https://samuelstroschein.com/blog/git-limitations)). The result is Lix, now at over [90k weekly downloads on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lix-js/sdk).

</p>

```bash
npm install @lix-js/sdk
```

```ts
import { openLix, selectWorkingDiff } from "@lix-js/sdk";

const lix = await openLix({
  environment: new InMemorySQLite()
});

await lix.db.insertInto("file").values({ path: "/hello.txt", data: ... }).execute();

const diff = await selectWorkingDiff({ lix }).selectAll().execute();
```

## What's next

The next version of Lix will be a refactor to be purely "preprocessor" based. This enables:

- **Fast writes** ([RFC 001](/rfc/001-preprocess-writes))
- **Any SQL database** (SQLite, Postgres, Turso, MySQL)
- **SDKs for Python, Rust, Go** ([RFC 002](/rfc/002-rewrite-in-rust))

```
