# Introducing Lix: An embeddable version control system

Changes AI agents make need to be reviewable by humans. 

For code, Git solves this: 

- **Reviewable diffs**: What exactly did the agent change?
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Review, then merge or reject.
- **Rollback changes**: Undo mistakes instantly.

Git is the right tool for source code repos. Git is optimized for developer workflows around repositories and files. But, embedding Git into applications (with semantic diffs, approvals, and queryable history) is complicated. We ran into these limitations building [inlang](https://inlang.com): ["Git is unsuited for applications"](https://samuelstroschein.com/blog/git-limitations).

## Introducing Lix

Lix is an **embeddable version control system** that runs inside your application so agents can propose changes and users can review, approve, and rollback in-product.

It records schema-aware changes (via plugins) to enable diffs, reviews, rollback, and querying of edits — **as part of your product**:

- **Track every action of agents** — see exactly what an agent did and when (edits, proposals, and approvals).
- **Display meaningful diffs** — show what actually changed in structured data and documents, without noisy line-by-line churn.
- **Rollback changes** — discard proposals, roll back state, and isolate experiments safely.

Typical flow: an agent opens a task branch → proposes changes → your UI shows a semantic diff → user approves → you merge into the main state → rollback is one action.

> [!NOTE]
> Lix does not replace Git for source code. Lix brings Git-like review and rollback into applications for agent-driven changes to app state and non-code artifacts.


## Schema-aware change tracking

Lix doesn't track line-by-line text changes. It tracks **semantic changes** at the entity level via plugins.

A plugin parses a format (or a piece of app state) into structured entities. Then Lix stores **what changed** — not just which bytes differ.

**Before:**
```json
{"theme":"light","notifications":true,"language":"en"}
```

**After:**
```json
{"theme":"dark","notifications":true,"language":"en"}
```

**Git tracks:**
```diff
-{"theme":"light","notifications":true,"language":"en"}
+{"theme":"dark","notifications":true,"language":"en"}
```

**Lix tracks:**
```diff
property theme:
- light
+ dark
```

### Excel file example

With an XLSX plugin (not shipped yet), Lix can show a cell-level diff like:
This is exactly the kind of semantic surface plugins define: cells vs formulas vs styling.

**Before:**

| order_id | product  | status  |
| -------- | -------- | ------- |
| 1001     | Widget A | shipped |
| 1002     | Widget B | pending |

**After:**

| order_id | product  | status  |
| -------- | -------- | ------- |
| 1001     | Widget A | shipped |
| 1002     | Widget B | shipped |

**Git tracks:**
```diff
-Binary files differ
```

**Lix tracks:**
```diff
order_id 1002 status:
- pending
+ shipped
```

The same approach extends to any other format your product cares about — **as long as there’s a plugin** that can interpret it.

## How does Lix work?

Lix turns changes into queryable data.

That means audit trails, rollbacks, and “blame” become simple queries:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM state_history
WHERE entity_id = 'settings.theme'
ORDER BY depth ASC;
```

Lix uses existing SQL databases as both **query engine** and **persistence layer**.

Plugins parse files (including binary formats) into "meaningful changes" e.g. cells, properties, whitespace, etc. Lix stores those changes as rows in virtual tables like `file`, `file_history`, and `state_history`.

Why this matters:

- **Doesn’t reinvent databases** — durability, ACID, and recovery come from proven SQL engines.
- **SQL API for changes** — complex queries for diffs, history, and audit trails are possible.
- **Runs in existing databases** — Lix can use your existing database as a persistence layer.

│            (SQLite, Postgres, etc.)             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This means: no separate infrastructure to manage, and no “special” datastore just for version control.

## Plugins (format support)

Lix’s format support depends on plugins. Here’s the current status:

| Format | Plugin | Status |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| JSON | `@lix-js/plugin-json` | Stable |
| CSV | `@lix-js/plugin-csv` | Stable |
| Markdown | `@lix-js/plugin-md` | Beta |
| ProseMirror | `@lix-js/plugin-prosemirror` | Stable |

**Building your own plugin:** take an off-the-shelf parser for your format, map it to Lix’s entity/change schema, and you get semantic diffs + history for that format. [Plugin documentation →](https://lix.dev/docs/plugins)

## Why did we build Lix?

Lix was developed alongside [inlang](https://inlang.com), open-source localization infrastructure.

We needed version control **embedded in the application**, not as an external tool. Git's architecture didn't fit: we needed database semantics (transactions, ACID), queryable history, and schema-aware diffing. [Read more →](https://samuelstroschein.com/blog/git-limitations)

The result is Lix, now at over [90k weekly downloads on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lix-js/sdk).

```bash
npm install @lix-js/sdk
```

```ts
import { openLix, selectWorkingDiff } from "@lix-js/sdk";

const lix = await openLix({
  environment: new InMemorySQLite()
});

await lix.db.insertInto("file").values({ path: "/hello.txt", data: ... }).execute();

const diff = await selectWorkingDiff({ lix }).selectAll().execute();
```

## What's next

The next version of Lix will be a refactor to be purely "preprocessor" based. This makes Lix easier to embed anywhere and enables:

- **Fast writes** ([RFC 001](/rfc/001-preprocess-writes))
- **Any SQL database** (SQLite, Postgres, Turso, MySQL)
- **SDKs for Python, Rust, Go** ([RFC 002](/rfc/002-rewrite-in-rust))
