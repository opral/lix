# Optimization Log 20: storage_v2 Baseline

Date: 2026-05-14

This log captures the first `storage_v2` adapter microbench baseline. Most
benchmarks intentionally use fake/counting `backend_v2` implementations so the
numbers mostly measure storage-layer shape and adapter overhead, not SQLite,
filesystem, cache, or transaction behavior. The final group runs the same paths
against `ConformanceBackend` to include real in-memory backend costs.

Command:

```sh
cargo bench -p lix_engine --features storage-benches --bench storage_v2
```

## Shape Guards

The benchmark asserts the access shape while measuring:

- write set lowering: staged puts/deletes across `G` spaces lower to at most
  one `put_many` and one `delete_many` call per touched space, then one commit.
- point reads: `M` requested keys lowers to `U` unique backend keys and one
  backend `get_many` call, then reconstructs `M` caller-order slots.
- prefix scans: `scan_prefix` lowers to one backend `scan_range` call.

## Complexity Contract

The timings below are useful only if they preserve the intended asymptotic
shape. Each bench group has an expected curve and a failure mode to watch for.

### Write Set Lowering Complexity

Expected today:

```text
K = staged mutations
G = touched spaces
B = backend write batches

stage:       O(K log G) with current BTreeMap grouping
validate:    O(K log K) with current duplicate-detection BTreeSet
stats:       O(K)
lower:       O(K + G)
backend I/O: B <= 2G
commit:      1 backend commit
```

Target after optimization:

```text
stage + validate + stats + lower: O(K + G) expected
backend I/O: O(G), not O(K)
commit: 1
```

Watch for:

```text
O(K * G) group lookup
O(K) backend calls
multiple commit boundaries
repeated full passes that can be fused
value-size costs caused by avoidable cloning/copying
```

Observed in this baseline:

```text
K scaling is roughly linear:
  128 -> 1024 -> 8192 puts scales in the expected direction.

G scaling does not show K*G blowup:
  G=16, G=64, and G=256 are not catastrophically worse.

Value size is visible:
  64 KiB values are much slower even with a counting backend, so value
  construction/accounting is part of the measured path.
```

### Point Read Adapter Complexity

Expected:

```text
M = requested caller-order slots
U = unique backend keys
F = found unique entries returned by backend

dedupe:              O(M)
backend get_many:    1 call over U keys
found map:           O(F)
slot reconstruction: O(M)

total adapter shape: O(M + U + F)
```

Watch for:

```text
O(M * U) reconstruction
O(M * F) missing checks
excess key/value cloning
missing-heavy reads getting slower despite fewer found entries
```

Observed in this baseline:

```text
M scaling is roughly linear:
  100 -> 1000 -> 10000 requested slots scales in the expected direction.

U matters:
  M=1000/U=100 is faster than M=1000/U=1000.

Missing-heavy reads are faster:
  fewer found entries reduce found-map work while storage still emits M slots.
```

### Prefix Scan Adapter Complexity

Expected:

```text
Q = emitted rows
P = prefix length

prefix-to-range: O(P)
backend scan_range: 1 call
result handling: O(Q)

total adapter shape: O(P + Q)
```

Watch for:

```text
more than one backend scan_range call
superlinear row handling
prefix lowering that allocates proportional to table size
```

Observed in this baseline:

```text
Q scaling is roughly linear:
  100 -> 1000 -> 10000 rows scales in the expected direction.

The q0 case isolates fixed adapter overhead:
  about 60 ns in this run.
```

### Conformance Backend Complexity

Expected:

```text
N = backend rows in the in-memory BTreeMap
K = committed mutations
U = unique point keys
M = requested point slots
Q = scan rows emitted

commit_puts: O(N snapshot + K log N)
get_many:    O(N snapshot + U log N + M)
scan_range:  O(N snapshot + N), with current snapshot cloning and full-map scan
```

This is intentionally not the same as the fake-backend adapter benches. The
`ConformanceBackend` is a correctness reference with real in-memory map and
snapshot behavior, so it includes costs that a production in-memory backend may
avoid with structural sharing or cheaper snapshots.

Watch for:

```text
ConformanceBackend being orders of magnitude slower than fake backend
snapshot cloning dominating every read
scan_range behaving like O(N) even for small Q
```

Observed in this baseline:

```text
ConformanceBackend is close enough to fake-backend timing for the current
small cases to be useful as an end-to-end in-memory reference.

The current implementation snapshots by cloning the BTreeMap and scan_range
iterates the snapshot instead of using a BTreeMap range. Larger N / small Q
bench cases should be added before using it as the final in-memory layout
answer.

Target production in-memory backend shape:

```text
begin_read:  O(1) or cheap structural-share snapshot
get_many:    O(U log N + M)
scan_range:  O(log N + Q)
commit_puts: O(K log N) plus one atomic publication step
```
```

## Notes

- `puts_k1024_g16_v32` being faster than `puts_k1024_g1_v32` is plausible with the current
  implementation because each group has fewer staged entries to move/lower;
  revisit after inspecting the write-set grouping internals.
- High space counts are not obviously worse in this fake backend baseline:
  `puts_k1024_g64_v32` is faster than the one-space case. This suggests the
  current hot cost is not just `BTreeMap` group lookup; validation, vector move
  size, and per-group batch construction should be inspected together.
- The 64 KiB value case is much slower, even though the counting backend does
  not persist bytes. This points at staging/value construction and `written_bytes`
  accounting as expected pressure points.
- Point read cost scales with caller-order reconstruction and unique-key
  dedupe. The `m1000_u100` case is faster than `m1000_u1000`, which is the
  intended benefit of deduping before backend access.
- Missing-heavy point reads are faster because the fake backend returns fewer
  found entries, but storage still reconstructs all `M` caller-order slots.
- Prefix scan numbers are mostly the fake backend cloning returned rows plus
  the prefix-to-range adapter path. This is useful as a shape baseline, not a
  real backend scan throughput result.
- The `ConformanceBackend` group is the first in-memory end-to-end reference:
  it includes `BTreeMap` backend behavior and snapshot cloning, so it should be
  read separately from the fake-backend adapter-only groups.
